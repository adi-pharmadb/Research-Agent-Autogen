- **📊 Context Processing**: Last 10 messages used for context (from max 50 stored)
- **🛡️ Validation**: Maximum 50 conversation messages per request
- **🧠 Memory**: Agent steps track conversation history processing

#### 2. **System Prompts**
- **🎯 Custom Expertise**: Override default agent behavior with specialized prompts
- **📏 Validation**: Maximum 2000 characters for system prompts
- **🔧 Integration**: Passed to research flow and used in response generation
- **📋 Templates**: Examples for regulatory affairs, clinical pharmacology, etc.

#### 3. **API Enhancements**
- **🚀 Enhanced Endpoint**: `/api/v1/research` supports new parameters
- **📊 Request Model**: `ResearchRequest` includes `conversation_history` and `system_prompt`
- **🔍 Agent Steps**: Detailed tracking shows conversation and prompt processing
- **📈 Response Format**: Context-aware responses reference previous discussions

### 🔧 Key Implementation Details

#### Conversation History Processing
```python
# Context processing (last 10 messages for efficiency)
conversation_context = ""
if conversation_history:
    context_messages = []
    for msg in conversation_history:
        role = msg.get("role", "user")
        content = msg.get("content", "")
        source = msg.get("source", role)
        context_messages.append(f"{source}: {content}")
    
    conversation_context = "\n".join(context_messages[-10:])
```

#### System Prompt Integration
```python
# System prompt override
base_system_prompt = "You are a pharmaceutical research expert."
if system_prompt:
    base_system_prompt = system_prompt
```

#### Enhanced Response Generation
```python
# Context-aware responses
if conversation_context:
    response_parts.append(f"# Continued Research Analysis: {question}")
    response_parts.append("*Building on our previous conversation*")
```

### 📋 API Usage Examples

#### Simple Conversation History
```json
{
  "question": "What about dosing for elderly patients?",
  "conversation_history": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Tell me about diabetes medications",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The main classes include metformin...",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:01:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Custom System Prompt
```json
{
  "question": "What are the FDA requirements for drug approval?",
  "system_prompt": "You are a senior regulatory affairs specialist with 15 years of FDA experience. Focus on regulatory compliance, safety data interpretation, and submission requirements."
}
```

#### Combined Features
```json
{
  "question": "What additional documentation would be needed?",
  "conversation_history": [
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": "What are FDA drug approval requirements?",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "system_prompt": "You are a regulatory affairs specialist..."
}
```

### 🎯 Business Impact

#### **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Contextual Conversations**: Users can have natural follow-up discussions
- **Specialized Expertise**: Custom system prompts provide domain-specific insights
- **Memory Continuity**: Conversations build naturally without losing context

#### **Technical Benefits**
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing API usage continues to work unchanged
- **Scalable**: Conversation history limited to prevent excessive token usage
- **Flexible**: System prompts allow customization for different use cases

#### **Use Cases Enabled**
1. **Multi-turn Research Sessions**: Progressive exploration of pharmaceutical topics
2. **Domain Expertise**: Regulatory affairs, clinical pharmacology, health economics
3. **Contextual File Analysis**: Follow-up questions about uploaded documents
4. **Personalized Responses**: Tailored analysis based on user's expertise level
