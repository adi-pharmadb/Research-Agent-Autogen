# 🧹 Codebase Hygiene Cleanup Summary

## 📊 **Cleanup Overview**
Date: 2025-06-03  
Project: PharmaDB Deep-Research Micro-Service  
Cleanup Type: Comprehensive hygiene audit and restructuring

## ❌ **Files Removed (13 total)**

### One-off Test Scripts (Violating coding preferences)
- `check_mexico_file.py` - One-off Mexico file checker
- `create_test_pdf.py` - One-off PDF creation script  
- `inspect_mexico_csv.py` - One-off CSV inspection script
- `test_alfatradiol_query.py` - One-off ALFATRADIOL test
- `test_direct_pdf_query.py` - One-off PDF test
- `test_file_queries.py` - One-off file query test
- `test_focused_regulatory_query.py` - One-off regulatory test
- `test_mexico_registry_query.py` - One-off Mexico registry test
- `test_mexico_tiarotec_fixed.py` - One-off TIAROTEC test
- `test_new_pdf.py` - One-off new PDF test
- `test_pdf_query.py` - One-off PDF query test
- `test_regulatory_pdf_query.py` - One-off regulatory PDF test
- `test_successful_csv.py` - One-off CSV test

**Rationale:** These violated the coding preference: "Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once"

## ✅ **Files Added/Created**

### Proper Test Structure
- `tests/__init__.py` - Test package initialization
- `tests/conftest.py` - Pytest configuration and fixtures
- `tests/test_api.py` - API endpoint tests
- `tests/test_tools.py` - Unit tests for data processing tools
- `tests/test_integration.py` - Integration tests for research flow
- `run_tests.py` - Proper test runner script

### Updated Dependencies
- Added pytest dependencies to `requirements.txt`
- Added test coverage support

## 🎯 **Benefits Achieved**

### 1. **Coding Standards Compliance**
- ✅ Eliminated one-off scripts
- ✅ Proper test organization
- ✅ Reusable test infrastructure

### 2. **Maintainability Improvements**
- ✅ Centralized test configuration
- ✅ Proper test fixtures and mocking
- ✅ Organized test categories (unit, integration, API)

### 3. **Development Workflow**
- ✅ Single command test execution: `python run_tests.py`
- ✅ Selective test running (unit, integration, API)
- ✅ Coverage reporting support

## 📋 **Remaining Considerations**

### Mixed Repository Structure
This repository contains both:
- **Your PharmaDB microservice** (in `app/` directory)
- **Entire AutoGen framework** (in `python/`, `dotnet/`, `docs/` directories)

**Recommendation:** Consider separating your microservice into its own repository for cleaner project management.

### Files to Keep
- `specs.txt` - Valid project specification document
- `Dockerfile` - Required for deployment
- `sample.env` - Template for environment configuration
- All `app/` directory contents - Core application code

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the new test suite:**
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py --coverage
   ```

2. **Consider repository separation:**
   - Extract PharmaDB microservice to its own repo
   - Keep only relevant AutoGen dependencies

3. **Continuous testing:**
   - Integrate `run_tests.py` into CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up automated testing on commits

## 📈 **Impact Summary**

- **Removed:** 13 unnecessary one-off scripts
- **Added:** 6 proper test files + test runner
- **Improved:** Code organization, maintainability, and testing workflow
- **Compliance:** Now follows all stated coding preferences

The codebase is now clean, organized, and follows best practices for testing and maintenance.
