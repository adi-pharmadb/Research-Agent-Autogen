      description: |
        Submit a natural language research question and get comprehensive AI analysis.
        
        The system will:
        1. Analyze your question using AI agents
        2. Determine appropriate research methods (web search, file analysis)
        3. Execute research using available tools
        4. Synthesize findings into a comprehensive answer
        
        **Response Time**: 3-8 seconds for typical queries, up to 2 minutes for complex multi-source analysis
        
        **Real Tool Execution:**
        - Live Tavily web search with actual URLs and content
        - CSV analysis using DuckDB SQL queries  
        - PDF text extraction using pdfplumber
        - Multi-agent workflow with detailed step tracking
        
        **Examples**:
        - "What are the side effects of metformin?"
        - "Find all diabetes drugs in the uploaded dataset"
        - "Analyze this clinical trial PDF for key findings"
